# Slack emoji

These are the emoji I like to add to any [Slack](https://slack.com) team I’m part of. Honestly, the ability to add custom emoji is one of the things I like most about Slack! `:sweat_smile:`

Some of these I created, but most of them I have sourced from various places around the web. Therefore, I don’t claim to `:air-quotes-left-hand:` own `:air-quotes-right-hand:` most of them. In other words, you have as much—or as little—right to use them as I do!

Feel free to submit PRs to add new ones, but know that I’m really picky, so I might not approve the change. `:grimacing:`
